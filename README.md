# pb-lists
Phantombot commands for listing alert and sound commands

Place listCommands.js in your scripts folder under /custom <make this folder if you don't have it> 
Will add two commands:

!listsounds will list all aliases that have an audiohook in them
!listalerts will list all the commands that alert

Useful for streams with lot going on and streamers with bad memories :-)
